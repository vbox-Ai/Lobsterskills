# Automation Triggers

OS 27 shortcuts can include native automation headers directly in exported shortcut XML. The portable carrier is the top-level `WFWorkflowTriggers` key, not a write to the user's live Shortcuts database.

Use this only when the user explicitly asks for an OS 27 automation shortcut or provides/exported automation samples. For ordinary shortcuts, omit `WFWorkflowTriggers`.

## Packaged Metadata

- ToolKit trigger metadata: `data/toolkit-v78-trigger-parameter-keys.json`
- Exported workflow trigger samples: `data/macos27-workflow-trigger-samples.json`
- ToolKit trigger variants: 42
- Variants with exported `WFWorkflowTriggers` samples: 42
- Missing exported samples: 0
- Minimum target: macOS/iOS 27

The lookup helper surfaces both ToolKit trigger parameters and exported plist samples:

```bash
python3 scripts/lookup_action_grounding.py --python-name when_low_power_mode_changes --target-os 27
python3 scripts/lookup_action_grounding.py --identifier com.apple.shortcuts.WFTimeOfDayTrigger.at_time_on_recurring_day --target-os 27 --json
python3 scripts/lookup_action_grounding.py --query "wi-fi trigger" --target-os 27 --json
```

## Plist Shape

Add `WFWorkflowTriggers` as a root key beside `WFWorkflowActions`:

```xml
<key>WFWorkflowTriggers</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>WFTriggerIdentifier</key>
    <string>WFLowPowerModeTrigger</string>
    <key>WFTriggerSerializedParameters</key>
    <dict>
      <key>WFLowPowerModeType</key>
      <string>both</string>
    </dict>
    <key>WFTriggerUUID</key>
    <string>GENERATE-A-FRESH-UPPERCASE-UUID</string>
  </dict>
</array>
```

Rules:

- Always generate a fresh `WFTriggerUUID` with `uuidgen | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'`.
- Validate with the default iOS 27 target (add `--target-os 27` only if you changed the default).
- Do not ship catalog placeholders such as `$placeholder`; they mark redacted local picker values.
- Raw exported automation XML can contain user-local contact, Mail, Messages, account, app, location, device, file, folder, and drive payloads. Sanitize those values before adding samples to the plugin.
- Do not infer a trigger header from ToolKit metadata alone. Use `workflowTriggerSample` from the lookup helper or an exported shortcut from the user.
- Local picker values such as apps, contacts, locations, alarms, devices, networks, Focus modes, Wallet merchants, sounds, files, folders, and drives must come from a complete user export format or be selected manually in Shortcuts. Current macOS 27 file/folder/drive exports are lossy and do not carry enough picker state in `WFWorkflowTriggers` alone.

## Observed Defaults

- Change-style triggers serialize on/off or connect/disconnect as `both`.
- Display uses `WFConnectionType` values `connect`, `disconnect`, or `both`.
- Stage Manager uses `WFStageManagerType` values `on`, `off`, or `both`.
- External Drive, File Modified, and Folder Changed export as bare trigger identifiers with empty serialized-parameters dictionaries, but those bare imports render as invalid automations in macOS 27 Shortcuts.
- External Drive automation exports appear buggy or under-specified in the current OS 27 build: specific disconnected exports serialize only the generic `WFDiskMountTrigger` carrier, an Any Drive Connected export contained no trigger header, and importing the generic carrier rendered invalid despite visible default choices.
- File Modified imports from the empty `WFFileTrigger` carrier render with no selected file.
- Folder Item Added, Item Removed, Item Modified, and Ignore Subfolders choices exported with the same `WFFolderTrigger` header; those UI choices are not represented in the observed `WFWorkflowTriggers` payload. After manual editor configuration, folder path/bookmark state and event choices are stored outside the portable trigger dictionary.
- The exported Any Drive Connected file did not include `WFWorkflowTriggers`, so the plugin should not infer a connected-only drive payload from it.
- Wi-Fi connect-to-any can omit serialized parameters; Wi-Fi disconnect uses `WFConnectionType = disconnected`.
- Sleep Bedtime Begins uses `WFSleepMode = bedtime`.
- Time of Day sunrise/sunset use `WFTimeEvent = sunrise` / `sunset`; the observed at-time sample stores `WFTime` as a plist date.
- Notification predicates use `Conditions`; Email and Message predicates use `WFEmailConditions` / `WFMessageConditions`.
- Battery Equal exported with an empty serialized-parameters dictionary even though ToolKit exposes threshold/comparison keys.

## Current Support

These variants have exported `WFWorkflowTriggers` samples and can be generated for OS 27 targets, subject to picker-value availability:

Observed support means the shortcut header can be generated and imported from exported XML. Runtime support is still device-specific. For example, a Low Power Mode trigger imported into macOS Shortcuts can render as "not supported on Mac" even though the same header is valid for iPhone/iPad automation testing. When the user asks for a Mac-only automation, prefer triggers verified in the macOS editor/runtime and avoid treating ToolKit platform provenance as a runtime guarantee.

All 42 ToolKit trigger variants now have at least one exported `WFWorkflowTriggers` sample. Some user-local picker choices are intentionally absent from the portable header and must still come from a complete export format or manual Shortcuts selection. In the current macOS 27 build, External Drive, File Modified, and Folder Changed are observed but not copyable from `WFWorkflowTriggers` alone.

## Validation

`validate_shortcut.py` checks `WFWorkflowTriggers` when present:

- OS target must be 27 or later.
- The root value must be an array of dictionaries.
- Each trigger must include `WFTriggerIdentifier`, `WFTriggerSerializedParameters`, and `WFTriggerUUID`.
- UUIDs must be uppercase real UUIDs, not placeholders.
- Serialized parameters must be dictionaries.
- Placeholder values from the static catalog are rejected.
- Known trigger identifiers and serialized parameter keys are checked against the exported sample catalog.
